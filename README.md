# Deploying T-Pot on Azure Virtual Machine to Monitor Honeypot Data

A honeypot is a sophisticated cybersecurity technique that involves deploying a decoy system deliberately designed to appear vulnerable and/or valuable to malicious actors. This strategy allows security analysts to monitor and study the behaviour of attackers. In this blog, I will demonstrate the deployment of T-Pot on an Azure Virtual Machine to monitor and analyze honeypot data, enabling the detection of potential cyber threats.

## What is T-Pot?

T-Pot is an open-source honeypot platform that emulates a variety of services and systems to attract and gather intelligence on attackers and their techniques. It is meticulously designed to mimic real-world systems and services, thereby presenting itself as a legitimate and enticing target for attackers. This facilitates the collection of valuable data on attack methodologies, which is critical for enhancing cybersecurity defenses.

## Creating our Honeypot VM

To deploy T-Pot on an Azure Virtual Machine, follow these steps:

### Access the Azure Portal

Log in to the Azure Portal.

### Create a Virtual Machine

1. Click on the "Create a resource" button, then select "Virtual Machine".

### Configure Basic Settings

1. **Name your virtual machine**: For example, "MYHPMAchines".
2. **Select or create a Resource Group**: For instance, "New_virtual".
3. **Choose your Region**: Select the region closest to you or your organization's operations, such as "West Europe".

### Select the Image

1. Under the Image section, click on "See all images" and search for "Debian 11 'Bullseye' - x64 Gen2".
2. Select this image to use it for your virtual machine.

### Choose the Size

In the Size section, select `D4s_v3`. This size offers a good balance of CPU, memory, and cost, which is suitable for running T-Pot.
